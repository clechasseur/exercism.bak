# exercism.bak

This repository contains all solutions I have published for exercises on the [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org) platform.
They can also be viewed on the platform directly on my [profile page](https://exercism.org/profiles/clechasseur/solutions).

The solutions are backed up using [`auxiliaire`](https://github.com/clechasseur/auxiliaire), a companion tool for Exercism (`#shamelessplug`).
